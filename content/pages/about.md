Title: About

As a structural biologist, I have a special interest in protein X-ray crystallography and structure determination, not as isolated knowledge but in a context of an interdisciplinary web of information that allows a deeper and wider understanding of biological processes and biochemical mechanisms.

Parallel to an active research career, I have always considered essential the ability to share knowledge and, most importantly, the enthusiasm of understanding how a particular process or mechanism works.

This site is one of many ways to bring together those key aspects of being a researcher .
