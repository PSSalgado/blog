Title: Sit and wait
Date: 2016-06-23 20:00


My home from home for 15 years  
Is voting today  
In or out, I have no say,  
despite my fears.    


As I sit and wait 
I think of love and hate<br>

For years I’ve said,<br>
With some pride and joy:<br>
“The UK is opened,<br>
Welcoming and proud<br>
Of cultures and people”

As I sit and wait<br>
I think of love and hate<br>

I came to study and stayed<br>
I felt welcome<br>
Valued and nurtured.<br>
My career flourished<br>
My life here grew roots.<br>

As I sit and wait<br>
I think of love and hate<br>

But lately, all this hate!<br>
Of all who aren’t “local”...<br>
Suddenly, my name is an issue<br>
My accent raises eyebrows.<br>
I have not changed,<br>
Why have you, UK?<br>

As I sit and wait<br>
I think of love and hate<br>

My home from home<br>
Decides today<br>
If it’s still my home<br>
Or wants to send me away<br>

I have no say,<br>
Just hope<br>
As I wait,<br>
Thinking of love and hate<br>
